     * This constructor is designed to initialize a `Menu` object. It takes
     * two parameters: a pointer to a character string `menuContent`, and an
     * optional integer `numberOfTabs` with a default value of `0`.
     * 
     * The constructor dynamically allocates memory to store the content
     * pointed to by `menuContent` in the member variable `m_text`. It then
     * scans `m_text` to count the number of newline characters (`\n`),
     * which is used to determine the number of options in the menu.
     * 
     * The `numberOfTabs` parameter specifies the number of indentation tabs
     * to be applied when displaying the menu. This allows for flexible
     * formatting of the menu display. If not provided, no tabs will be
     * applied by default.

    /**
     * The display method is responsible for presenting the Menu content to
     * the user. It first outputs the menu options and a new line. Following
     * the list of options, it prints:
     * 
     * ```
     * 0- Exit
     * > _
     * ```
     * 
     * This provides an option for the user to exit the menu and also indicates
     * where the user can input their choice.
     * 
     * If the number of tabs attribute is not zero, the display method will
     * indent the menu. Each tab corresponds to three spaces. This allows for
     * adjustable formatting of the menu display.
     * 
     * Here are examples of how the menu would be displayed:
     * 
     * A menu with no indentation (i.e., `number of tabs` is `0`):
     * 
     * ```
     * Tester Options menu:
     * 1- Option one
     * 2- Option two
     * 0- Exit
     * >
     * ```
     * 
     * A menu with `number of tabs` set to `2`:
     * 
     * ```
     *       Tester Options menu:
     *       1- Option one
     *       2- Option two
     *       0- Exit
     *       >
     * ```
     * 
     * In the second example, each line of the menu is indented by six spaces
     * (two tabs * three spaces per tab) for a more structured visual
     * presentation. This feature enhances the flexibility and user-
     * friendliness of your menu system.
